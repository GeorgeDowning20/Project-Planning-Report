Student provides an overview of the main project aim that clearly and concisely sets out what the project must achieve and the importance of the work. A diagram is included that shows consideration of the main system components (hardware and/or software) or processes and how these are interconnected.

Project overview makes use of suitable references to support the engineering context of the project (e.g. use of academic papers for key concepts that will be applied).

Project overview makes use of suitable references to support the commercial context of the project (e.g. using market data to show consumer demand).

The project diagram makes good use of stylistic features (colour, font styles, groupings, shapes, etc) to intuitively separate sub-systems and components within the overall project. Use of styles are consistent.

Project diagram demonstrates complete understanding of critical component level design requirements (for example a MCU block might include peripheral/memory/clock needs, software routines may include API, algorithm, limitations, data type, execution time requirements).

The project diagram clearly shows, and where necessary explains, dependency between parts.
