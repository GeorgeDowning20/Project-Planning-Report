Student provides a list of some obvious expected risks that could impact completion of the project with inclusion of risks that are specific to the project methodology. Risks are accompanied by suitable mitigation actions.

The potential impact of risks on the project are realistically quantified in terms of time/cost/change in spec. Risks are sorted by impact.

Mitigation actions are realistic given the resources available to the project.

The likelihood of risks occurring are quantified with a method applied to sort the importance of each risk.

There is clear indication of when each risk is likely to occur in the project and this is considered as part of the mitigation actions.

All critical risks to the project are fully mitigated and quantified (rated) pre and post mitigation.
